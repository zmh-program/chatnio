### ✨ Zeabur (One-Click)
[![Deploy on Zeabur](https://zeabur.com/button.svg)](https://zeabur.com/templates/M86XJI)

> Zeabur provides a certain free quota, you can use non-paid regions for one-click deployment, and also supports plan subscriptions and elastic billing for flexible expansion.
> 1. Click `Deploy` to deploy, and enter the domain name you wish to bind, wait for the deployment to complete.
> 2. After deployment is complete, please visit your domain name and log in to the backend management using the username `root` and password `chatnio123456`. Please follow the prompts to change the password in the chatnio backend in a timely manner.

### ⚡ Docker Compose Installation (Recommended)
> [!NOTE]
> After successful execution, the host machine mapping address is `http://localhost:8000`

```shell
git clone --depth=1 --branch=main --single-branch https://github.com/Deeptrain-Community/chatnio.git
cd chatnio
docker-compose up -d # Run the service
# To use the stable version, use docker-compose -f docker-compose.stable.yaml up -d instead
# To use Watchtower for automatic updates, use docker-compose -f docker-compose.watch.yaml up -d instead
```

Version update (_If Watchtower automatic updates are enabled, manual updates are not necessary_):
```shell
docker-compose down 
docker-compose pull
docker-compose up -d
```

> - MySQL database mount directory: ~/**db**
> - Redis database mount directory: ~/**redis**
> - Configuration file mount directory: ~/**config**

### ⚡ Docker Installation (Lightweight runtime, commonly used for external _MYSQL/RDS_ services)
> [!NOTE]
> After successful execution, the host machine address is `http://localhost:8094`.
> 
> To use the stable version, use `programzmh/chatnio:stable` instead of `programzmh/chatnio:latest`

```shell
docker run -d --name chatnio \
   --network host \
   -v ~/config:/config \
   -v ~/logs:/logs \
   -v ~/storage:/storage \
   -e MYSQL_HOST=localhost \
   -e MYSQL_PORT=3306 \
   -e MYSQL_DB=chatnio \
   -e MYSQL_USER=root \
   -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=chatnio123456 \
   -e REDIS_HOST=localhost \
   -e REDIS_PORT=6379 \
   -e SECRET=secret \
   -e SERVE_STATIC=true \
   programzmh/chatnio:latest
```

> - *--network host* means using the host machine's network, allowing the Docker container to use the host's network. You can modify this as needed.
> - SECRET: JWT secret key, generate a random string and modify accordingly
> - SERVE_STATIC: Whether to enable static file serving (normally this doesn't need to be changed, see FAQ below for details)
> - *-v ~/config:/config* mounts the configuration file, *-v ~/logs:/logs* mounts the host machine directory for log files, *-v ~/storage:/storage* mounts the directory for additional feature generated files
> - MySQL and Redis services need to be configured. Please refer to the information above to modify the environment variables accordingly

Version update (_After enabling Watchtower, manual updates are not necessary. After execution, follow the steps above to run again_):

```shell
docker stop chatnio
docker rm chatnio
docker pull programzmh/chatnio:latest
```

### ⚒ Compile and Install

> [!NOTE]
> After successful deployment, the default port is **8094**, and the access address is `http://localhost:8094`
> 
> Config settings (~/config/**config.yaml**) can be overridden using environment variables. For example, the `MYSQL_HOST` environment variable can override the `mysql.host` configuration item

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Deeptrain-Community/chatnio.git
cd chatnio

cd app
npm install -g pnpm
pnpm install
pnpm build

cd ..
go build -o chatnio

# e.g. using nohup (you can also use systemd or other service manager)
nohup ./chatnio > output.log & # using nohup to run in background
```

## 🤯 Why Create This Project & Project Advantages

- We found that most AIGC commercial sites on the market are frontend-oriented lightweight deployment projects with beautiful UI interface designs, such as the commercial version of [Next Chat](https://github.com/ChatGPTNextWeb/ChatGPT-Next-Web). Due to its personal privatization-oriented design, there are some limitations in secondary commercial development, presenting some issues, such as:
  1. **Difficult conversation synchronization**, for example, requiring services like WebDav, high user learning costs, and difficulties in real-time cross-device synchronization.
  2. **Insufficient billing**, for example, only supporting elastic billing or only subscription-based, unable to meet the needs of different users.
  3. **Inconvenient file parsing**, for example, only supporting uploading images to an image hosting service first, then returning to the site to input the URL direct link in the input box, without built-in file parsing functionality.
  4. **No support for conversation URL sharing**, for example, only supporting conversation screenshot sharing, unable to support conversation URL sharing (or only supporting tools like ShareGPT, which cannot promote the site).
  5. **Insufficient channel management**, for example, the backend only supports OpenAI format channels, making it difficult to be compatible with other format channels. And only one channel can be filled in, unable to support multi-channel management.
  6. **No API call support**, for example, only supporting user interface calls, unable to support API proxying and management.

- Another type is API distribution-oriented sites with powerful distribution systems, such as projects based on [One API](https://github.com/songquanpeng/one-api).
Although these projects support powerful API proxying and management, they lack interface design and some C-end features, such as:
  1. **Insufficient user interface**, for example, only supporting API calls, without built-in user interface chat. User interface chat requires manually copying the key and going to other sites to use, which has a high learning cost for ordinary users.
  2. **No subscription system**, for example, only supporting elastic billing, lacking billing design for C-end users, unable to meet different user needs, and not user-friendly in terms of cost perception for users without a foundation.
  3. **Insufficient C-end features**, for example, only supporting API calls, not supporting conversation synchronization, conversation sharing, file parsing, and other functions.
  4. **Insufficient load balancing**, the open-source version does not support the **weight** parameter, unable to achieve balanced load distribution probability for channels at the same priority ([New API](https://github.com/Calcium-Ion/new-api) also solves this pain point, with a more beautiful UI).

Therefore, we hope to combine the advantages of these two types of projects to create a project that has both a powerful API distribution system and a rich user interface design,
thus meeting the needs of C-end users while developing B-end business, improving user experience, reducing user learning costs, and increasing user stickiness.

Thus, **Chat Nio** was born. We hope to create a project that has both a powerful API distribution system and a rich user interface design, becoming the next-generation open-source AIGC project's one-stop commercial solution.
